Heroku:
Had to remove secrets.yml from the .gitignore and modified to make it a little bit more secure
Modifed the Procfile to start rails with -p $PORT
Created config\initializers\secret_token.rb
Added heroku:config set SECRET_TOKEN='xxx' using rake secret to create xxx

Usage:
  Let's assume you're adding into cuentas_controller.rb a listing of movimientos. To do so you have to specify routes.rb as follows:
  concern :list do
    get :list, on: :collection
  end

  resources :movimientos, concerns: [:list] do
    collection do
      get :list
    end
  end

  resources :cuentas do
    collection do
      get :list
    end
    member do
      get :list_movimientos
    end
  end
